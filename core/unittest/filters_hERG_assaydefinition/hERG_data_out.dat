Potassium Channel Assay: Drugs belonging to different classes have been shown to be associated with QT prolongation and in some cases serious ventricular arrhythmias. The most common mechanism for these adverse events is the inhibition of one or more cardiac potassium channels, in particular hERG. This current is important for cardiac myocyte repolarization and is a common target for drugs that prolong the QT interval. Test articles in this study were therefore characterized to determine their ability to inhibit the hERG channel. Ion channel activity was measured using a stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line expressing the hERG mRNA. The pharmacology of this cloned channel expressed in the CHO cell line is very similar to that observed in native tissue.
