Inhibition Assay: The hERG potassium current was measured in a hERG-stably-expressing Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO) cells. The experiments were performed using an automated planar patch-clamp system QPatch HTX (Sophion Bioscience A/S). The application of pressure for forming gigaseals and whole-cell patch clamp configuration were established using the QPatch assay software. Patch-clamp experiments were performed in voltage-clamp mode and whole-cell currents were recorded. The following stimulation protocol was applied to investigate the effects of compounds on hERG potassium channel.The membrane potential was held at ¿80 mV and repetitively (every 15 seconds) depolarized to +20 mV for 4800 milliseconds after the pulse to ¿50 mV for 20 milliseconds served to define the baseline, followed by repolarizing step to ¿50 mV for 5000 milliseconds to evaluate of the tail current amplitude. Experiments were conducted at room temperature.
