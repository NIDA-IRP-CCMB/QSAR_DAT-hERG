Dopamine transporter	Homo sapiens	1534807	B	D	Direct protein target assigned	9	Autocuration	Binding Assay: In order to evaluate the relative affinity of the various compounds at the NE, DA and 5HT transporters, HEK293E cell lines were developed to express each of the three human transporters. cDNAs containing the complete coding regions of each transporter were amplified by PCR from human brain libraries. The cDNAs contained in pCRII vectors were sequenced to verify their identity and then subcloned into an Epstein-Barr virus based expression plasmid (Shen et al., Gene 156:235-239 (1995), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). This plasmid containing the coding sequence for one of the human transporters was transfected into HEK93E cells. Successful transfection was verified by the ability of known reuptake blockers to inhibit the uptake of tritiated NE, DA or 5HT.For binding, cells were homogenized, centrifuged, and then resuspended in incubation buffer (5 mM Tris, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, pH 7.4).

Dopamine transporter	Homo sapiens	1534807	B	D	Direct protein target assigned	9	Autocuration	Binding Assay: In order to evaluate the relative affinity of the various compounds at the NE, DA and 5HT transporters, HEK293E cell lines were developed to express each of the three human transporters. cDNAs containing the complete coding regions of each transporter were amplified by PCR from human brain libraries. The cDNAs contained in pCRII vectors were sequenced to verify their identity and then subcloned into an Epstein-Barr virus based expression plasmid (Shen et al., Gene 156:235-239 (1995), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). This plasmid containing the coding sequence for one of the human transporters was transfected into HEK93E cells.
